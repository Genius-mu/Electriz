# 🚀 Day 2/100 - React Landing Page

This is the **Day 2** project of my **100 Days Mission** to become a better Frontend Developer.  
Today, I built a **Landing Page** using **React**, and learned how to use some essential React libraries and concepts to make the project cleaner and more efficient.

## 🧠 What I Learned

How to structure my code in the best way. I learnt how to use those react Libraries very well.

### 🧩 React Libraries Used:

- **Framer Motion** → For smooth animations and transitions.
- **Lucide React** → For clean and beautiful icons.
- **React Router DOM** → For page navigation and routing.

### ⚙️ React Concept Used:

- **useState Hook** → To store and manage my card data dynamically.

## 💡 What I Built

I created a simple **Landing Page** with animated sections and reusable components.

One cool thing I did was in the **Cards Section**:
Instead of writing and styling each card manually, I stored all the card data (like title, description, and icon) inside an **array of objects** using `useState`.  
Then, I used **`.map()`** to render each card dynamically — making my code cleaner, shorter, and easier to update later.
